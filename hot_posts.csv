0,ELI5- Why do we need a growing population?,1049,16m3pq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/16m3pq1/eli5_why_do_we_need_a_growing_population/,710,"It just seems like we could adjust our economy to compensate for a shrinking population. The answer of paying your working population more seems so much easier trying to get people to have kids they don‚Äôt want. It would also slow the population shrink by making children more affordable, but a smaller population seems far more sustainable than an ever growing one and a shrinking one seems like it should decrease suffering with the resources being less in demand.",1695062864.0

2,ELI5 - why doesn't the water in our pipes get bacteria/viruses in it?,1592,16lxdzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/16lxdzg/eli5_why_doesnt_the_water_in_our_pipes_get/,315,"It seems like you would get pretty nasty germs happily living in our plumbing (especially untreated well water). 

I think about the water that can sit for prolonged periods in hot water tanks, stagnant water in dead end sections of the plumbing system (unused outside faucet etc), and the wet oxygen rich environment inside the faucet ends. 

Yet you almost never hear about people getting sick from their waterü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",1695048018.0
3,ELI5: How do computers KNOW what zeros and ones actually mean?,47,16mli6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/16mli6c/eli5_how_do_computers_know_what_zeros_and_ones/,87,"Ok, so I know that the alphabet of computers consists of only two symbols, or states: zero and one.

I also seem to understand how computers count beyond one even though they don't have symbols for anything above one. 

What I do NOT understand is how a computer knows* that a particular string of ones and zeros refers to a number, or a letter, or a pixel, or an RGB color, and all the other types of data that computers are able to render.

*EDIT: A lot of you guys hang up on the word ""know"", emphasing that a computer does not know anything. Of course, I do not attribute any real awareness or understanding to a computer. I'm using the verb ""know"" only figuratively, folks ;). 

I think that somewhere under the hood there must be a physical element--like a table, a maze, a system of levers, a punchcard, etc.--that breaks up the single, continuous stream of ones and zeros into rivulets and routes them into--for lack of a better word--different tunnels? One for letters, another for numbers, yet another for pixels, and so on? 

I can't make do with just the information that computers speak in ones and zeros because it's like dumbing down the process human communication to the mere fact of relying on an alphabet.",1695112598.0
4,Eli5 - how many airborne divisions were there? Why is the 101st so famous?,603,16m3hnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/16m3hnq/eli5_how_many_airborne_divisions_were_there_why/,129,"Recently reading the headlines about Band of Brothers coming from HBO tho Netflix and it got me thinking:

- how does the US military divide up it's soldiers? (Eg regiment vs troop vs platoon vs squadron)

- are there different rules for each branch of the military?

- I've only ever heard of the 101st airborne division but not other ones... Was there a 100th division? 99th division, etc? Why is the 101st so famous?",1695062353.0
5,ELI5: Why were loudspeakers used during the Vietnam War?,170,16m9rxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/16m9rxr/eli5_why_were_loudspeakers_used_during_the/,49,"I was watching a movie that took place in Vietnam War and saw that they put large loudspeakers on tanks, boats and even on helicopters. On another TV Series, Generation Kill that took place in Iraq War, they don't have such things. Soldiers usually sing by themselves.

I'm wondering:

* what was the purpose of loudspeakers? 
* why they don't use it anymore?",1695076836.0

Health advocates say ""Junk food is bad and to cut it out"" but what exactly is it?

Would you describe other types of take away as being ""fast food or ""junk food"" such as Indian take away and Chinese take away?

What primarily are the ""bad parts"" of ""junk food""?

What types of restaurants, food outlets  would not be considered ""junk food""?",1695074680.0
